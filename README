A one-liner to provide benchmarking for your favorite JS REPL:
var bench=function(n,f){var s=+new Date(),c=f?n+1:2,f=f||n;while(--c)f();return +new Date()-s};

Perhaps more interestingly, you can download index.html (or open it online at
http://spencertipping.com/js-instabench) and use it to benchmark things. It comes
with a number of examples, and you can also write your own.
